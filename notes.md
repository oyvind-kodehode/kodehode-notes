### Plagiarism

Originality vs plagiarism, where is the limit?

If a trademark can be confused with another in the same trade, it can be 
considered plagiarism.

#### Examples of similar logos

Loen Skylift vs Voss Gondol. The court decided it was plagiarism because 
there are similar elements in the logo and they are in the same 
business.

Xeptor IT Distribution vs Norsk Tipping. The logo has the same shape, 
but the colors are different. It was not considered plagiarism because 
they're different trades.

Northug vs CSN Media AS.

Polestar vs Citroën. The logos are very different, but because there's a 
similar element (the angles) and they're both in the car business, it 
was considered plagiarism.
